#Capstone project from Codecademy. Colmar Academy

##New to coding, this was one of my first attempts to use html and css to fulfil a design brief.

Over all I am happy with the result however there are some issues with the shrinking of images on the .info-right class due to my use of flexbox. I intend to come back to fix this when I become more familiar with coding. 

I am very happy with the result of the @media query for mobile devices. I also added addtional media queries at natural break points, beyond what was stated in the design brief, to tidy up the content for varying screen sizes.

The original design breif image is below if you wish to compare it to my final result.

I welcome any advice on how to improve my code.
